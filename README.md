RL agent learning to land a spacecraft in Gymnasium's LunarLander environment, extending to multi-agent coordination with PettingZoo.

## Tech Stack

- **Gymnasium** — RL environment (LunarLander-v3)
- **PettingZoo** — multi-agent environments (planned)
- **PyTorch** — neural network for DQN
- **TensorBoard** — training visualization
- **NumPy / Matplotlib** — data handling and plotting

## Status

In progress — implementing DQN from scratch.  
no vibecoding!
